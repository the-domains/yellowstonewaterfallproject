"I was enthralled by the determination, and subsequent discovery made by Mike Stevens, Lee Whittlesey and Paul Reubenstein. I saw an opportunity to add an illustrative aspect like that of Bierstadt and Moran."

A pivotal feature of Yellowstone becoming the first National Park in world history was deeply rooted in the fact that it was fine-art that had inspired Congress to make it so. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c0590c02-a66a-4344-8d01-1653320103ff.jpg)

Stories and adventures from John Colter were no longer romanticised myths after the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871\. Artist Thomas Moran and photographer William Jackson brought back hard evidence to support the surreal stories from mountain men, trappers and fur traders. A landscape riddled with hot pots, fumerals and geysers had been immortalized in oil paint in the way of the old masters. To an artist or connoisseur these pieces had weight and pull in a deep and meaningful way.

That's why it's happening, again, and in a big way.  With explorer Mike Stevens as guide, MC Poulsen filling the shoes of Thomas Moran, and PBS Producer Mike Gualdoni following suit for William Jackson. This trio of professionals will embark on a journey back to a road less traveled.

"This project is a tip of the cap to those who came before us. We hope to honor their sacrifices and accomplishments through youth education and enrichment programs with the Yellowstone Park Foundation and Museums around the world". -Project Director M. Chandler Poulsen
