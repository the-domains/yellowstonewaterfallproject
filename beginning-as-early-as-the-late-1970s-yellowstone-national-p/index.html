<p>Beginning as early as the late 1970's Yellowstone National Park archivist and historian, Lee H. Whittlesey, was already underway on a project to document the history of all the known waterfalls in Yellowstone (about 50). In the 1980's, park employee Mike Stevens began an independent mission to photograph all of these waterfalls. Then, in the 1990's, when Paul Rubinstein came on-board, the three began a new quest to survey as many of the previously unexplored rivers and creeks in the parks remotest backcountry as possible. They had no idea that their seven years of exploring the Yellowstone wilderness would yield so much new information. Over 300 waterfalls have been recently discovered in Yellowstone with many more tributaries left to explore. A book was printed as a guide to the lost, discovered and rediscovered falls of Yellowstone.

<p>Stories and adventures from John Colter were no longer romanticised myths after the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871. Artist Thomas Moran and photographer William Jackson brought back hard evidence to support the surreal stories from mountain men, trappers and fur traders.

To an artist or connoisseur these pieces had weight and pull in a deep and meaningful way.</p><p>That's why it's happening, again, and in a big way.  With explorer Mike Stevens as guide, MC Poulsen filling the shoes of Thomas Moran, and PBS Producer Mike Gualdoni following suit for William Jackson.
